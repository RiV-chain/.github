## Flagship Technologies

### v6Space‚Ñ¢  
A self-organizing, end-to-end encrypted IPv6 overlay network. Enables static, cryptographic IP addressing for secure access to a large spectrum of devices including IoT devices, AI Agents, servers, AI inference endpoints, NAS devices, and many more applications.

### CupLink‚Ñ¢  
Lightweight, encrypted distributed video calling service over mesh networks environment with self generated identity (IPv6). Requires v6Space VPN service to establish mesh network environment for peer-to-peer communication.

### Distributed DNS & VPN  
Built-in distributed naming and routing systems to replace legacy infrastructure with encrypted, infrastructure free alternatives.

## What We Build

- Decentralized, portable infrastructure for FinTech, AI inference, and embedded devices  
- Mesh-native networking for coordination of IP cameras, LLMs, NAS, and smart systems  
- Remote private inference AI with support for:  
  - **LM Studio**  
  - **Open WebUI**  
  - **Ollama**  
  - **Text Generation WebUI**
  - **vLLM**  
  - and more

- Peer-to-peer calling applications like CupLink‚Ñ¢ that require v6Space‚Ñ¢ VPN service to establish mesh network environment for peer-to-peer communication.

- Decentralized IPv6 mesh network infrastructure (v6Space‚Ñ¢) that enables secure connectivity between devices.
